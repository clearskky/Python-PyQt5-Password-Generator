# Python-PyQt5-Password-Generator
This is a password generator

You can enter how long you want your password to be and the script will give you a randomly generated password made out of special characters, letters and numbers then copy it to the clipboard.


pwordGen.py contains the function that actually generates the password, pwordGenUI.py imports that function and incorporates it into an interface so, you need to launch pwordGenUI.py
